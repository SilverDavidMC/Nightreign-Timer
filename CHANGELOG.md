# 1.1.0
- Changed how the warning sound is handled.
	- It is now a custom sound that can be replaced by the user. This can be done by adding a sound named `warning.wav` to the `sounds` folder, or by changing the file location of the sound in settings.
	- Volume now also controls if the sound will play or not. Setting the volume to 0 will prevent the sound from playing.
	- Volume is now a range of 0-100 instead of 0-50.
	- The volume setting uses a slider slider instead of a spinner, and the settings screen has a button to hear how loud the sound will be.
- The window can now be resized to be larger if desired.
- Added a border around the start button because it looks better with one.
